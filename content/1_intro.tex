\section{What is Ion Shell}

Ion Shell is a program written in rust.
It is maintained on a git repository on the gitlab server for redox os ecosystem \cite{ion_shell}.
It is a shell which executes commands within a terminal emulator via read evaluation loop.
Like other shells, Ion Shell also allows the execution of scripts in its own language.
It serves as the default shell on redox os.
As moment of writing ion shell can also be used on Linux.
This shell is interpreted statement by statement.
There is an online manual for the usage of ion shell available \cite{ion_shell_online_manual}.

The work which was performed during the it project resolved mainly around the scripting aspect of Ion Shell.
Because of this the scripting language of Ion Shell is introduced in more details as a preamble.
To better illustrate certain aspect of scripting with this shell, certain differences between It and bash are discussed.

\subsection{Typing in Ion Shell}

As an example Bash only operates on text and does have not have concept of types.
Ion Shell on the other hand works in structural typing.
A certain section of the online manual of Ion Shell lists all possible types \cite{ion_shell_types}.
Form this reference we conclude that Ion shell has following primitive types:

- str
- bool
- int
- float

And also provides these structural typing via:

- Array:
- Hashmap:
- Btreemap:

Working with these types instead of just text provides a better detection of programming errors.
Since Ion Shell is interpreted statement by statement, these errors are caught at runtime though.

It is important to note there is no nominal typing in Ion Shell.
Formal Declaration of objects or structs with named fields is not possible like in other programming languages like Rust, Java, C\# etc ..

To better illustrate how scripting in Ion Shell looks like, a few core features are explained with code snippet as examples.

\subsection{Expansion}\label{ion_shell_lang_expansion}

Ion Shell also supports expansion functionallity.

\subsection{String and array methods}\label{ion_shell_lang_methods}

There are builtin utility functions avaible for scripting  called methods.
There are 2 kinds of methods.
The kind of method is determined by the type of the return value.
Every kind of method is prepended with its own sigil

\begin{itemize}
	\item String methods. Prepended with a "\$" sigil. Returns a string. See \ref{code:ion_string_methods} as an example.
	\item Array methods. Prepended with a "@" sigil. Returns an array. See \ref{code:ion_array_methods} as an example.
\end{itemize}
